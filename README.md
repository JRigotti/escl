# ESCLI
The elasticsearch command line is an utility program wrapping around the
[elasticsearch.js](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-js) client.

## Disclaimer
This is side project I've built in my spare time with the purpose of helping me
out with repetitive tasks I use to perform in Elasticsearch. It's not encouraged
and advised to be used in a production environment and/or where sensitive data
is being handled.

## Contributing
Contribuitions and improvements in accord with the project philosophy are gladly
accepted. Make sure to check the [contribuiting](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for
